MoonSprings is an arcade and time management game about how good you can operate an alien hotspring.

# The story behind MoonSprings
## How the project was born
MoonSprings was born in 2022 by a group of students. 
It became a year long project that helpped us to live wonderful experiences in many events like [Cometcon Gijón](https://cometcon.org/24/) and [BIG Conference](https://www.bilbaogamesconference.com) thanks to the support of the [University of A Coruña](https://comunicacion.udc.es/es)

You can check the old project [here](https://github.com/duartemv00/game_moonSprings). Or watch a the [trailer](). You can even [play](https://holychilligames.itch.io/moonsprings) the game.

## The project in 2024
2 years later I'm trying to improve that game in terms of code, but little by little in my free time.
