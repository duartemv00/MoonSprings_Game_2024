MoonSprings is an arcade and time management game about how good you can operate an alien hotspring.

# The story behind MoonSprings
## How the project was born
MoonSprings was born in 2022 by a group of students. 
It became a year long project that helpped us to live wonderful experiences in many events like [Cometcon Gijón](https://cometcon.org/24/) and [BIG Conference](https://www.bilbaogamesconference.com) thanks to the support of the [University of A Coruña](https://comunicacion.udc.es/es)

## The project in 2024
2 years later, as I'm currently working at [Pentakill Studios](https://pentakillstudios.com), I decided to ramake the game in a more optimized and scalable way.
